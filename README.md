## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion

City Gardens is an initiative created in conjunction with local communities and Dublin City Council, the aim of this initiative is to encourage people who live in the inner city, particuraly in apartment and flat complexes to spend some time outside gardening and socialising using public lands divided into allotments which can be used by members of the public.

People can take an allotment for the purpose of gardening and producing fruit and vegetables, these are located in different parts of Dublin city, to allow people from different suburbs to participate in the initiative.

They is a small fee to be able to join and members need to optimally mantain the plot, optionally  fruit and veg can be produced, and 10% of this produce can be sold at local markets so the community gardens can have further social events, core funding is provided by Dublin City Hall and the fees. When first signing up people recieve a free starter pack including a gardening and horticulture book to make the best use of the land.

The websites purpose is to highlight the avilability of the service, where the alotments are located and offer a facility for users to find information such as contact details, growing guides and gardening tips. The alotments are available for people of all ages and skillsets.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Eggplant palette](docs/palette-eggplant.png)

The colour palette selected uses a mix of tones based on an eggplant theme, it uses a very trendy bright green colour combined with shades of greys and blacks, to complement the eggplant colour which is used in the imagery. The colours have high contrast and light colours are used gainst dark background colours and vice versa. 
The final colour palette was created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website. 
Some other alternatives and shades based on the selected palette were:
[Tomato vine palette](docs/palette-tomato-vine.png)
[Violet field palette](docs/palette-violet-field.png)


There was some colour exploration using [Adobe Colour Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) website, some colours were brought to Coolors website extracted from imagery planned to use on the site to further explore the visual possibilities.

### Typography

The fonts were taken from Google Fonts:

*  Karla is used for headings and subheadings on the site. It is a serif font that combines well with the body copy font, which is sans-serif, serif and sans-serif fonts offer good contrast.

*  Monstserrat is used for the body text on the site. It is a sans-serif font with good readability optimal to use for web.  

*  Lobster is used on the logo with a slight drop shadow for better visibility. It is a display cursive font. The logo leaf icon was taken from font awsome and combined with this font.

### Imagery

The images are taken from the royalty free sites credited [here](#Credits).
