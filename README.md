City Gardens is a community garden allotment group. People can take an allotment for the purpose of gardening and producing fruit and vegetables, these are located in different parts of Dublin city, to allow people from different suburbs to participate in the iniciative.

They are free but to be able to join members need to be active in the community and produce some fruit and veg, 10% of this produce is sold at local markets so the community garden can have further social events, core funding is provided by Dublin City Hall.
